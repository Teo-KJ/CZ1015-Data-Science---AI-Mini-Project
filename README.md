CZ1015 Data Science & AI project
================================


## What we want to explore:

- **CAN HAPPINESS BE USED FOR THE QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS OF STOCK PRICES?**


## Data Sets from:

1.  *World Happiness Report*  
    <http://worldhappiness.report/ed/2018/>

2.  *Yahoo Finance*  
    <https://finance.yahoo.com/>

## Conclusion:
While exponential smoothing methods (Eg. Holt-Winter Exponential Smoothing) and
RNNs were somehow able to predict the trend, they were unable to produce results
that had low MSE, possibly due to the modelâ€™s inability to learn from long-term
dependencies.
